This is a text file to keep track of all of the things I am learning about react. 

--- React ---

React is a javascript library

1. This will take the two typescript files: Message.tsx and App.tsx, and build a virtual DOM. App is parent, Message is child.
2. When the data of a component changes, React updates the corresponding node in the virtual DOM. 
3. Then it compares the old version of the DOM to the virtual DOM to see what nodes need to be updated.
4. React will then update those nodes in the DOM. 

// React does not directly update the DOM. react-dom does.

// Components in React can only be one element big.

hmr update - hmr stands for 'hot module replacement' which just means we have made a change to the app


--- Typescript + JSX ---

function Message() {
    // This syntax is JSX: JavaScript XML - Meaning this will be converted into javascript. 
    const name = 'Savanna';
    return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>; 
}

    return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>; -> {name} can be replaced here with a function like {getName()} for example

// class is reserved in Javascript. It must be className
